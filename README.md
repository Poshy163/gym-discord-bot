# Gym Discord Bot

A Discord bot that reads the gym-stats posts your friends already write, parses
out the equipment + weight, and tracks progress month-by-month so you can
settle all "did you actually get stronger?" debates with data.

## What it tracks

Auto-parses posts like:

```
Shoulder press: 45 kg
Lat pulldown: 43 kg
Bench Press: 55 kg
Incline bench 70
Dips: BW+20kg
Leg Press: 6 plates
Leg curls: 50 - 77 kg
@Cookie Monster squat 55kg
```

Rules it uses:

- `equipment: value` (or bare `equipment value` when a `kg` / `plates` unit is
  present) is treated as a lift.
- `Xkg` / `X kg` -> X kg.
- `N plates` -> N × 20 kg (configurable via `PLATE_KG` in `app/parser.py`).
- `BW+Xkg` -> X kg recorded with the bodyweight-add flag.
- `A - B kg` range -> the higher number (treated as top working weight).
- A leading Discord user mention logs the lift for that person instead of the
  message author, so `@Cookie Monster squat 55kg` stores Cookie Monster's squat.
- Passive auto-logging only stores structured lift lines such as
  `leg press 295kg`, `squat: 70kg`, or `@Cookie Monster calf raise 90kg`.
  Conversational sentences are ignored unless you explicitly run `/parse`.
- Weights over `MAX_WEIGHT_KG` are skipped as likely typos/fakes. The default is
  `500`, which catches mistakes like `2200kg` before they hit leaderboards.
- Many aliases are unified (e.g. `pec dec`, `pec fly`, `chest fly`, `pekdek`
  all become `pec dec`). See `app/aliases.py`.

The bot reacts with ✅ on messages whose lifts were stored, and de-duplicates
per `(message_id, equipment)` so edits / re-parses won't double-count.

## Slash commands

Every command also works in a **DM with the bot** (and as a user-installed app),
not just in a server channel — see [Direct messages](#direct-messages) below.

Stats & progress:

- `/help` — in-bot command reference.
- `/server [server]` — only useful in DMs: pick which server your DM commands
  act on when you're in more than one with the bot. With no argument it shows
  your current default and the servers you share.
- `/stats [user]` — personal bests for a user.
- `/summary [user]` — profile overview (totals, top PRs, most trained, gains,
  current weekly streak).
- `/coach [user] [days]` — an AI progress report built from **all** of a
  member's tracked data (lifting summary, PRs, biggest gains, goals, training
  frequency, bodyweight trend, and calorie/protein goals + recent totals). The
  whole dataset is handed to Gemini, which writes a personalised strength +
  nutrition breakdown with concrete next steps. It's told that missing/zero
  values mean "not logged" (a tracking gap to nudge about), not real zeros — so
  it won't claim you ate 0 calories or lost progress just because data is
  absent. Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- `/overview <equipment> [user]` — consistency overview for one lift: logs,
  active weeks, streak, spacing, current weight, and best.
- `/checkin [user]` — copy/paste stat template prefilled with current bests.
- `/stale [user] [days]` — lifts that haven't been updated recently.
- `/progress <equipment> [user]` — best lift per calendar month, with deltas.
- `/graph <equipment> [user]` — PNG chart of daily-best weight over time with a
  running-best reference line.
- `/history <equipment> [user]` — per-entry timeline for one user.
- `/recent [user] [limit]` — most recent entries across all equipment.
- `/leaderboard <equipment>` — top 25 of **this server's members** for that
  lift. Lifts are global per user, so each member is ranked by their all-time
  best across every server, but the board itself only lists this community.
- `/machine <equipment>` — everyone's timeline on one lift.
- `/compare <user> [equipment]` — head-to-head PRs with a win tally.
- `/serverstats` — server-wide totals, top lifters, and popular equipment.
- `/daily_update [days_ago]` — post a daily server recap (PRs, active lifters,
  popular lifts).

Goals:

- `/goal_set <equipment> <target_kg> [bodyweight]` — set a personal goal.
- `/goals [user]` — show active goals with percentage progress bars.
- `/goal_remove <equipment>` — remove one of your goals.

When a logged lift reaches a goal, the bot celebrates with 🎯 in its reply and
clears the goal automatically.

Lifts, PRs and goals are **global per user** — everything you log follows you
across every server the bot is in (and DMs): your bests, history, tonnage,
streaks, `/progress`, `/coach`, goals and `/stats` all aggregate every server.
Only the *social* surfaces stay per-community: `/leaderboard`, `/machine` and
`/serverstats` show this server's members/activity (ranked by global bests).
Editing/cleanup of **your own** data is global too (`/change_weight`,
`/rename scope:mine`, `/delete_entry`), while guild-wide admin ops
(`/rename scope:all`, `/purge`) deliberately stay scoped to the current server.

Calories:

- `/calories setup <target> [weekend]` — set your daily intake target. Accepts
  kcal or kJ (`2500`, `2500c`, `8700kj` — kJ is converted at 4.184 kJ/kcal).
  On its own that one target applies **every day**. Add `weekend:` for a
  different Saturday/Sunday target — `/calories setup 1500 weekend:2200` — and
  each day is scored against whichever applies, with replies labelled *Using
  Weekday Targets* / *Using Weekend Targets*. Re-running `setup` without
  `weekend:` leaves an existing weekend target alone; `weekend:same` drops it.
- `/calories targets [user]` — show both target sets and which one today falls
  under.
- `/calories add <amount> [note]` — log something you ate, again in kcal or
  kJ. The reply shows a progress bar against that day's target.
- Or just type it in chat: a message that is **only** an amount — `650kcal`,
  `200c`, or `2700kj` — gets logged automatically, the bot reacts ✅ and
  replies with your running total. The message must be nothing but the amount
  (so "1500cal is crazy work" is ignored); add a description with
  `/calories add` instead. `@user 650kcal` logs it for someone else.
  Chat calorie posts are also picked up by the startup/`/backfill` history
  scan (deduped per message, dated to the original post), so messages sent
  while the bot was offline — or before you set a target — get imported once
  you've run `/calories setup`.
- **Backdating:** add a day to a chat log to file it under that day —
  `650kcal yesterday`, `200c monday`, `coffee yesterday`, `40p 3 days ago`, or
  an ISO date (`500c 2026-06-28`). Works for calorie, protein, saved-food and
  combined posts; the reply notes the day it landed on. The slash commands take
  it too: `/calories add 650 day:yesterday`, `/protein add 40 day:monday`.
- `/calories today [user]` — today's entries and total vs today's target.
- `/calories week [user]` — per-day totals for the last 7 days (with your 🔥
  logging streak). Each day is measured against the target that was live on
  that day; with weekday/weekend targets the footer also breaks out weekday and
  weekend averages and adherence.
- `/calories leaderboard` — ranks the server's trackers by current logging
  streak.
- `/calories edit <amount> [note]` — fix the amount of your most recent entry.
- `/calories undo` — remove your most recent entry. To remove a *specific*
  entry instead, react ❌ on the bot's `🍽️ +N cal` reply for it (the logger,
  the target, or an admin can do this).
- **Edit to fix:** editing the original chat message updates the stored entry —
  e.g. correcting `1730c` to `1730kj` recomputes the calories; deleting the
  amount removes it.
- **Streaks:** log on consecutive days and the bot shows a 🔥 streak on replies
  and in `/calories week`; it stays alive until a whole day passes unlogged.
- `/calories stop` — stop tracking (history is kept; `setup` re-enables).

Calorie tracking is **global per user** — your daily goal, saved foods and
logged entries follow you across every server the bot is in, and in DMs. (Same
for protein and bodyweight.)

Targets are **effective-dated**: changing a goal applies from today onward, and
days you've already logged keep being scored against the target that was live at
the time — so bumping your goal on a Thursday never silently rewrites last
week's report.

Saved foods (personal name → calorie shortcuts):

- `/calories food_set <name> <amount> [protein]` — save a food, e.g.
  `/calories food_set coffee 5` or `/calories food_set "protein shake" 250kj 30`.
  The optional **protein** (grams) is logged automatically whenever you log the
  food — handy for shakes, chicken, etc. Re-running `food_set` with just a new
  calorie amount updates the calories and **keeps** the saved protein.
- Then log it by **just typing the name** in chat — `coffee`, or `2 coffee` /
  `coffee x2` for multiple servings — and the bot reacts ✅. If the food has a
  protein value and you're protein-tracking, it logs both at once (one ❌ undoes
  both). `/calories add coffee` works too.
- `/calories food_list` — show your saved foods (with protein where set).
- `/calories food_remove <name>` — delete one.

Saved foods are per-user, so your `coffee` and someone else's can be different
amounts. Chat shortcuts only fire on an exact full-message match of a food
you've defined (optionally with a serving count), so normal chatter is never
mistaken for food. They're matched live only — unlike `650kcal`-style posts,
plain food words aren't picked up by the history backfill.

Everyone with a calorie target gets a personal AI summary in the weekly
report (see below).

### Protein (optional daily max)

A lightweight, separate tracker for keeping protein **under** a daily ceiling
(it flags when you go over, rather than nudging you to hit a goal).

- `/protein setup <grams> [weekend]` — set your daily max, e.g. `180`. Like
  calories, that one number covers every day unless you add a separate weekend
  max (`/protein setup 180 weekend:200`); `weekend:same` drops it again.
- `/protein add <grams> [note]` — log protein, e.g. `/protein add 40 chicken`.
- Or just type **`40p`** / **`40g protein`** / **`protein 40`** in chat — the
  bot reacts ✅ and replies with your running total vs your max (with a ⚠️ once
  you're over). An explicit `p`/`protein` marker is required, so a bare number
  or a `40kg` lift is never mistaken for protein.
- `/protein today [user]` · `/protein week [user]` — totals vs your max (with
  your 🔥 logging streak).
- `/protein edit <grams> [note]` — fix the amount of your most recent entry.
- `/protein undo` — remove your most recent entry, or react ❌ on the bot's
  reply to remove that specific one (the logger, the target, or an admin).
- `/protein stop` — stop tracking (history kept; `setup` re-enables).

**Log both at once:** a message with both amounts — e.g. `500c and 40p` (also
`40p 500c`, `2700kj and 40g protein`) — records the calorie *and* the protein
entry together and replies with both totals. Only what you're tracking is
logged; the rest is skipped with a note. React ❌ on the reply to remove both.

Logging & editing:

- `/log <equipment> <weight_kg> [user] [bodyweight]` — manual entry, optionally
  for another user (🎉 on PRs).
- `/bodyweight [weight_kg] [user]` — record (or view) your current bodyweight.
  You can also just post `bodyweight 100kg` (or `body weight: 100kg`, or
  `bw 80`) in chat, and `@user bodyweight 100kg` to set someone else's.
  Once on file, the bot annotates bodyweight-relative lifts with the **true
  load** in inline replies and the leaderboard:
  - assisted pull-up logged as `pull ups 70kg` with bodyweight 100kg →
    **30kg actual** (machine assistance is subtracted)
  - weighted dip logged as `BW+20kg` with bodyweight 100kg →
    **120kg actual**
- `/undo` — remove your most recent entry.
- **React ❌ on the bot's reply** to undo the specific lifts that reply stored.
  The logger and target lifter can do this; other users' reactions are ignored.
- `/parse <message_id>` — re-parse a specific message in the current channel.
- `/delete_entry <equipment> <date>` — remove one day's entries.
- `/change_weight <equipment> <weight_kg> [user] [date]` — change the latest
  matching entry's weight for you or another user.
- `/swap_weights <first_equipment> <second_equipment> [user] [date]` — swap
  weights between two latest matching entries (for example, leg curl ↔ leg
  extension when a post mixed them up).

Discovery & utilities:

- `/equipment_list` — every canonical equipment name the bot knows.
- `/aliases <equipment>` — all spellings the parser accepts for a lift
  (including any custom aliases configured in this server).
- `/export [user]` — download lifts as a CSV attachment.
- `/ping` · `/version`

Maintenance (available to everyone):

- `/backfill [limit]` — rescan this channel's history.
- `/rename <old> <new>` — merge one equipment name into another. Defaults to
  *your* rows and applies **globally** (every server); `scope:all` renames the
  whole server's rows (and repoints its aliases) and stays scoped to it.
- `/purge <equipment>` — delete every row for a lift name in **this server**
  (guild-wide admin op; doesn't reach other servers).
- `/alias_add <phrase> <equipment>` — teach the bot a server-specific alias
  (e.g. "hack sled" → "leg press"). Custom aliases apply to both
  slash-command inputs and auto-parsed chat messages.
- `/alias_remove <phrase>` · `/alias_list`

Auto-parsing also celebrates PRs: when a stored lift beats your previous best
for that equipment, the bot's reply tags it with 🎉 and shows the old → new
weight. PRs are **all-time across every server** (lifts are global per user), so
beating a best you set elsewhere still counts. Duplicate posts (same
`message_id` + equipment) get a 🔁 reaction instead of a second ✅ so nothing is
double-counted.

Long stat dumps are compacted in bot replies after `PARSE_REPLY_MAX_ITEMS`
rows so check-ins don't flood the channel. The entries are still stored; the
reply just hides the tail.

Presence & sleep (requires `ENABLE_PRESENCE_TRACKING=true`):

- `/track start <user>` · `/track stop <user>` — (owner) begin/stop recording a
  member's online/offline transitions.
- `/track schedule <user> [days]` — online/offline summary, per-weekday and
  per-hour heatmap, and an estimated sleep window.
- `/track raw <user> [days]` — raw status/activity timeline.
- `/track export <user> [days] [fmt]` — (owner) DM yourself a member's derived
  sleep data. `fmt=csv` gives a nightly sleep table (bedtime, wake, hours);
  `fmt=json` gives the full raw presence dump plus sessions.
- `/track analyze <user> [days]` — send the derived sleep sessions to
  Google's Gemini API and get back plain-language trends (anyone can run it on
  a tracked member). Requires
  `GEMINI_API_KEY` (see `.env.example`); `GEMINI_MODEL` defaults to
  `gemini-2.5-flash`.

Sleep data here is *inferred* from Discord presence (long offline stretches),
not a real sleep tracker — treat it as an approximation.

## Weekly check-in reminder

Set `REMINDER_CHANNEL_ID` in `.env` to have the bot post a weekly prompt asking
everyone to drop their current bests. Defaults are **Wednesday 12:00** in
`DISPLAY_TIMEZONE` (defaults to `Australia/Adelaide`, which handles ACST/ACDT
automatically). Tune with `REMINDER_WEEKDAY` (0=Mon … 6=Sun), `REMINDER_HOUR`,
`REMINDER_MINUTE`, and optionally `REMINDER_ROLE_ID` to @mention a role.

## Weekly bodyweight reminder

A second weekly reminder nudges everyone to update their bodyweight via
`/bodyweight` so true-load annotations on pull-ups, dips, etc. stay accurate.
By default it inherits `REMINDER_CHANNEL_ID` and posts **Monday 07:30** in
`DISPLAY_TIMEZONE`. Tune with `BODYWEIGHT_REMINDER_CHANNEL_ID`,
`BODYWEIGHT_REMINDER_WEEKDAY`, `BODYWEIGHT_REMINDER_HOUR`,
`BODYWEIGHT_REMINDER_MINUTE`, and `BODYWEIGHT_REMINDER_ROLE_ID`.

## Daily gym update

Set `DAILY_UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID` in `.env` to have the bot post a daily recap of
yesterday's activity: total lifts, active lifters, popular lifts, and PRs.
Defaults are **08:00** in `DISPLAY_TIMEZONE`. Tune with `DAILY_UPDATE_HOUR` and
`DAILY_UPDATE_MINUTE`. Empty days are skipped by default; set
`DAILY_UPDATE_POST_EMPTY=true` if you want a quiet "no lifts" update too.

## Weekly report (Sunday)

Every Sunday evening the bot posts a 7-day recap: total lifts, PRs, most
active members, popular lifts — plus a **🍎 weekly calorie check-in** with a
short Gemini-written summary for each member tracking via `/calories`
(adherence to target, consistency, one encouraging note) and a **🥩 weekly
protein check-in** (days logged, average vs max, and how often they went over).
Without `GEMINI_API_KEY` the calorie section falls back to plain stats lines;
the protein section is always plain stats.

Every day in these reports is compared against the target that was active on
that day, so someone running a bigger weekend target isn't scored as having
overeaten on Saturday. For those members the AI summary also receives weekday
and weekend averages so it can talk about the two bands separately.

The channel comes from `WEEKLY_REPORT_CHANNEL_ID`, falling back to
`DAILY_UPDATE_CHANNEL_ID` then `REMINDER_CHANNEL_ID`. Defaults are **Sunday
18:00** in `DISPLAY_TIMEZONE`; tune with `WEEKLY_REPORT_WEEKDAY`,
`WEEKLY_REPORT_HOUR`, and `WEEKLY_REPORT_MINUTE`. `/weekly_report` posts the
same report on demand.

## Strava workout feed

Link members' Strava accounts and the bot posts an embed to
`STRAVA_FEED_CHANNEL_ID` the moment they finish an activity (run, ride, lift,
etc.) — distance, time, pace, heart rate, and a link back to Strava. It uses
OAuth2 + Strava's real-time webhook push, so the bot runs a small web server
that must be reachable over public HTTPS.

Quick version: register a Strava API app, set `STRAVA_CLIENT_ID`,
`STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET`, `STRAVA_PUBLIC_URL` and `STRAVA_FEED_CHANNEL_ID`, run
`/strava_subscribe` once (owner), then members run `/strava_link`. Full
walkthrough — including the reverse-proxy setup — is in
[docs/STRAVA.md](docs/STRAVA.md). Set `STRAVA_DISABLED=1` to turn it off.

Commands: `/strava_link`, `/strava_unlink`, `/strava_status`, `/strava_latest`
(show the most recent activity on demand), and owner-only `/strava_subscribe`,
`/strava_subscription`, `/strava_unsubscribe`.

## Direct messages

You can run **any** command in a DM with the bot, not just in a server channel.
Because a DM has no server attached, the bot has to work out *which* server's
data to use:

- If you share exactly **one** server with the bot, it's used automatically.
- If you share **several**, run `/server` once to pick a default (it has
  autocomplete). Change it any time with `/server` again.
- If the bot can't tell, it asks you to set one with `/server`.

**Privacy:** you can only look up another user's info if you **share a server**
with them. Looking up someone you don't share a server with is refused — this
holds in DMs and in servers alike.

For DM commands to appear, the app must be enabled as a **User Install**
integration in the Discord Developer Portal (Installation → enable *User
Install*), and each person re-authorises the app to their account. Guild-only
installs keep working in servers exactly as before.

## Web dashboard

An authenticated operator dashboard (separate web server, default port `8081`)
for browsing and editing everything the bot tracks without touching Discord:

- **Overview** — server totals and the most recent activity.
- **Members** — searchable list with avatars; drill into one member for their
  lift/nutrition counters, **today's calories & protein vs goal** (progress
  bars), a **bodyweight trend chart**, **lift goals**, their **saved foods**
  (add/edit/delete, with protein), roles, linked Strava/Revo, and history.
  You can **grant or remove roles** on a member (the ✕ on a role chip, or the
  **+ Add role** picker), **remove a timeout** (the Moderation box shows an
  active timeout and a **Remove timeout** button when the bot can act), and
  **invite a user by ID** (➕ Invite by ID): the bot mints a one-use invite and
  DMs it to them, falling back to a copyable link if their DMs are closed. All
  three are written to the audit log. They need the bot to have **Manage Roles**
  / **Moderate Members** / **Create Invite** in the target server, and Discord
  still enforces role hierarchy (it can't assign a role above its own top role,
  or moderate someone who outranks it).
- **Roles** — each role with its colour and live member list.
- **Messages** — a per-channel chat log of **everything** members post: full
  text, and a **permanent local copy of every attachment** (images, videos, GIFs
  and any other uploaded file) so they survive Discord's expiring CDN links and
  message deletion. Edited messages show their latest text (tagged *edited*) and
  deleted ones are flagged 🗑️ rather than vanishing. Controlled by
  `ENABLE_MESSAGE_LOGGING` / `ENABLE_MEDIA_DOWNLOAD` (see `.env.example`).
- **Leaderboard** — pick an exercise and see the ranked best lifts (with
  medals + avatars).
- **Audit log** — a unified, filterable, paged trail of role changes (including
  *who* made them), member join/leave/nickname/username changes and kicks/bans,
  and every data event: logs, **undos/reverts** (with who triggered them),
  goals, bodyweight, saved foods, and dashboard edits.
- **Lifts / Calories / Protein** — the raw entries, searchable, with inline
  delete and (for lifts) edit. Every change is written to the audit log.

Profile pictures appear throughout, and the whole thing is a modern dark UI.

**Auto un-timeout** (`AUTO_UNTIMEOUT=true`, the master switch, on by default):
the bot immediately clears any timeout placed on a **protected** member,
recording each removal in the audit log. Protection is opt-in **per user** — open
a member in the dashboard → **Moderation** → **Protect from timeouts** (toggle it
back off there too). With nobody protected, nothing happens. It needs **Moderate
Members** and a role above the target (Discord enforces both), and never acts on
the guild owner or anyone it doesn't outrank.

It is **off until you set `WEBUI_PASSWORD`**. Enabling it also turns on the
privileged **Server Members** intent, which you must additionally toggle on for
the bot in the Discord Developer Portal. Full setup is in
[docs/WEBUI.md](docs/WEBUI.md).

## Setup

1. Create a Discord application + bot at <https://discord.com/developers/applications>.
   Enable the **Message Content Intent** on the Bot page.
2. Copy the bot token.
3. Invite the bot to your server with scopes `bot` + `applications.commands`
   and at minimum these permissions: View Channels, Send Messages,
   Read Message History, Add Reactions, Use Slash Commands. To use the
   dashboard's **role grants** add **Manage Roles**, for **remove timeout** add
   **Moderate Members**, and for **invite by ID** add **Create Invite**. To let
   commands run in DMs, enable the **User Install**
   integration under *Installation* in the Developer Portal (see
   [Direct messages](#direct-messages)).
4. Clone this repo on your server and create `.env` from the template:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env and paste DISCORD_TOKEN
   ```

5. (Optional) set `GYM_CHANNEL_IDS` to a comma-separated list of channel IDs
   so the bot only auto-parses the gym channel(s).
6. Run it:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

Data lives in the `gym-data` Docker volume at `/data/gym.sqlite3` — back it up
if you care about your PRs.

## Local development

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate      # PowerShell
pip install -r requirements.txt
copy .env.example .env      # edit token
python -m app.bot
```

Set `GUILD_ID` in `.env` during development so slash commands register
instantly on your test server instead of waiting for the global rollout.

## Notes on numbers

Different gyms calibrate cable machines differently, so the weight numbers
aren't directly comparable between people on pulley exercises. The bot just
records what you post — take cross-gym leaderboards with a pinch of salt.
